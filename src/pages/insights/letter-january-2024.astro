          To our clients and partners,
        </p>

        <p class="text-lg">
          As we enter a new year, it seems appropriate to reflect on the nature of the work we do together.
        </p>

        <p class="text-lg">
          The past year brought no shortage of market movements, economic headlines, and reasons for concern or optimism depending on one's perspective. Throughout these fluctuations, we remained focused on the principles that guide our approach: structure, discipline, and long-term clarity.
        </p>

        <p class="text-lg">
          We do not attempt to predict short-term market movements. We do not adjust portfolios based on headlines. We do not confuse activity with progress.
        </p>

        <p class="text-lg">
          This restraint is not passive—it is intentional. It reflects our conviction that the greatest threat to long-term wealth is not market volatility, but the behavioral responses it provokes. Panic selling, performance chasing, and constant repositioning are far more destructive to wealth than any market decline.
        </p>

        <p class="text-lg">
          Our role is to provide the structure and perspective that makes disciplined behavior possible. When markets fall, we remind clients that this is expected and planned for. When markets rise, we counsel against complacency. In all conditions, we focus on the decades ahead rather than the quarters behind.
        </p>

        <p class="text-lg">
          The families we serve share this orientation. They understand that wealth preservation is a multi-generational endeavor. They value stability over excitement. They recognize that the best decisions are often the ones not made.
        </p>

        <p class="text-lg">
          As we look ahead, we remain committed to this approach. We will continue to prioritize structure over speculation, governance over reaction, and clarity over noise.
        </p>

        <p class="text-lg">
          We are grateful for your continued trust.
        </p>
